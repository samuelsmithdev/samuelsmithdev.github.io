<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
<p>I first used a home PC at a very young age to play video games with my mother such as Putt Putt goes to the Moon and Pajama Sam. Computers and technology became fun at an early age. In high school I used them to complete classwork and create music in my spare time. Computers then became further more interesting to me when I realized they were a doorway into my creativity.<br />I started studying programming and video game development after I left high school and fell in love with programming. Not only video game development but also software development. I decided to start my studies at RMIT due to the great student feedback and reputation of the school. The ability to study online is also a bonus as I have to continue work fulltime. I wish to learn the ins and outs of IT and the industry. My goal is to also aim to study Computer sciences to further my learning.</p>

<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
<img src="job.jpg" alt="Ideal Job" width="500" height="600" />
<p>This position allows me to utilize my skills in my favorite language and further my use of React JavaScript. The job style contains challenging and hard work which I love most about work and achieve most satisfaction from. I currently am confident in C#, JavaScript and SQL though id need to become more proficient in NET MVC, React, WCF and WPF. I can acquire these skills via online learning and creating demo projects for myself to prove my work.</p>

<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
<p>I took the Myers-Briggs personality test and was given the Protagonist personality style ( https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality ). After taking an online learning test a received the auditory learning style ( http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-styles.shtml ). Finally, a big five test (https://my-personality-test.com/results/5506885223527460990/big-5) returned with a medium-high level of extraversion, high level of agreeableness (of which I don&rsquo;t agree with) and a medium level of neuroticism. According to these results I'd make a good team leader however I don&rsquo;t think I'd take up the position unless it was needed.</p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The project idea is a mobile App called &ldquo;Eating Green&rdquo; that finds the nearest vegan foods to the user's location. It also contains a function to take an image of a food and respond if whether the item is vegan or not so that users can make the correct decisions while doing grocery shopping without having to look through the ingredients list on an item.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>According to the national nutrition survey VeganAustralia.org.au estimates that 2% of Australia's population is vegan (Vegan FAQ, 2021). Which comes to approximately 500,000 vegans having to struggle through shopping centers and take away apps to find out what foods they are able to eat that will keep them on track with their constricted diet. Using the power of the modern-day mobile phone, googles Cloud Vision API and camera object detection we can make the lives of vegan Australians much more efficient.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Android and iOS mobile device store users can download the Eating Green app from the app store. From there when they open the app, they are greeted by a welcome screen along with a google services login screen (google Identity API). The app then asks for your device's location and camera permissions. From here you have a screen with two buttons and a small settings cog icon at the top of the screen with the option to sign out of google services and contact information to the developer so that users can have direct contact to support if anything goes wrong with the app. One of the main buttons takes you to a maps screen which highlights all the nearby vegan eating locations within a radius of the user's selection. This is viewable in list format or maps format. Users can select a location and either upvote or downvote it and leave reviews. This gives other local vegans an indication on whether a restaurant is worth checking out. If the location isn't vegan but has vegan options the app will indicate so. Users also have the ability to recommend certain items and even recommend certain combination of an item (e.g., &ldquo;I recommend ordering this burger with vegan mayonnaise.&rdquo;). The other main button is an item scanning function. The user places their phones camera over an object. The object is then scanned and it responds with a green tick over the item if its vegan or a red cross if it's not. If the item has trouble being scanned into the API it comes back with an &ldquo;Error. Please try again or contact support.". If an item comes back as being vegan users, then get a selection of recommendations under &ldquo;other shoppers also loved these&rdquo;. The recommendation list consists of items that other users had scanned in and upvoted.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>Using Visual studio, we can use Microsoft's Xamarin CLI we can build the apps front end. From here we need something to run our map's function, a user database, user recommendations and the camera item recognition. Google has many handy APIs for app building. We can use Google Identity API for logins, Google Maps Platform API for our maps function and Google Cloud Vision API for the item scanning functions. Using WAMP server we can store, send and receive data for our app functions over the web.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>We will need Visual Studio with Xamarin installed and a WAMP server installed.The previously mentioned technologies require programming skills and knowledge in languages such as MySQL, PHP, C# and XAML. With these 4 languages we can control the WAMP server and Xamarin development along with the use of the Google APIs. These skills can be easily learnt with online courses.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>If this project were to be successful the vegan population of Australia will have their diet and lifestyle simplified giving them time to focus on other things rather than spending hours researching how to live their restrictive lifestyles.</p>
